<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
  Implementing the drawing of Bezier curves and surfaces for the first part of
  the assignment was relatively simple. Taking control points as an input, our
  algorithm performs a series of recursive linear interpretations to implement
  Casteljau's algorithm in both 2D and 3D space. The latter part of the
  assignment dealt with the editing of triangle meshes. The first task involved
  implementing area-weighted normals. The crux of this task was finding the
  formula for calculating the area of a triangle in 3-dimensional space. Edge
  flips and edge splits were the next two parts. This task was far more complex
  than the previous tasks. Our initial attempt at edge flips involved
  meticulously rotating each pointer of an edge. However, this approach left
  room for error in reassigning all the pointers. For both flips and splits, we
  took diagrams of the triangles, labeling each half-edge, edge, vertex, and
  face meticulously in both the pre-flip and post-flip diagrams and reassigning
  each pointer based on our diagram. Edge splits involved an additional step of
  creating new vertices, edges, and faces as well. The final task of the
  assignment, loop subdivision, involved both edge splits and then flips. An
  issue we initially ran into was the labeling of "new" edges that were created
  from edge splitting and making sure we weren't flipping too many edges.
  Overall, the project helped solidify the more abstract concepts covered in
  lecture and taught both us partners the importance of drawing out diagrams
  and writing out pseudocode before implementing--a technique that saved us far
  more time debugging.

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
  De Casteljau's algorithm is an algorithm to evaluate Bezier Curves given a
  set of <code>n</code> control points and parameter <code>t</code>. The
  algorithm is implemented by recursively linearly interpolating at the
  parameter <code>t</code> each set of pairs of control points in order to
  compute the next subdivision level's set of intermediate control points. One
  step produces <code>n - 1</code> intermediate control points, and the
  recursive steps repeat until the algorithm reaches a final singular control
  point. This final control point lies on the Bezier curve at parameter
  <code>t</code>. Thus, we can construct the entire Bezier curve by running de
  Casteljau's algorithm for all <code>t</code>.

  We implemented the recursive step by iterating over the list of control
  points, represented by <code>Vector2D</code>s, performing $lerp(p_i, p_{i+1},
  t)$ for each pair of points $p_i$ and $p_{i+1}$, and returning the resulting
  intermediate control points in a <code>vector</code>.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
  A Bezier curve of degree $n$ is defined by $(n + 1)$ control points. It is a
  parametric curve based on a single parameter $t$, ranging between 0 and 1.
  Similarly, a Bezier surface of degree $(n, m)$ is defined by $(n + 1) × (m +
  1)$ control points. It is a parametric surface based on two parameters $u$
  and $v$, both ranging between 0 and 1. De Casteljau's algorithm extends to
  Bezier surfaces by simply adding one more dimension of evaluation. Each row
  of control points defines a single Bezier curve based on parameter $u$. All $n$
  of these Bezier curves evaluated at $u$ defines another Bezier curve based on
  parameter $v$.
</p>
<p>
  To evaluate a Bezier surface at $(u, v)$ using de Casteljau's algorithm, we
  first individually evaluate the $n$ Bezier curves defined by each row of
  <code>controlPoints</code> at $u$ by calling <code>evaluate1D()</code> on
  every row of <code>controlPoints</code>, storing the result in a
  <code>std::vector&lt;Vector3D&gt;</code>. Finally we evaluate that new set of
  control points at $v$ for the final, single point in a <code>Vector3D</code>.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
  We implement area-weighted vertex normals in <code>Vertex::normal()</code>. A
  <code>Vector3D</code> is initialized to store the running sum of face
  normals. We start iteration with the current vertex's halfedge. We first
  calculate the area of the triangle with the following formula: $area = \frac
  {\|{\vec{AB} \times \vec{AC}\|}} {2}$. Then we divide the normal of the
  halfedge's face with the area of the triangle, and sum this into our running
  sum. The <code>HalfedgeCIter</code> is updated to
  <code>h->twin()->next()</code> for the next iteration. Finally, after we
  reach the starting halfedge and the loop terminates, we return the normalized
  vector sum of area-weigthed normals.
</p>

<p>
  Phong shading with vertex normals is very noticeably smoother. The shading
  gradually changes across a single face instead of remaining constant across
  the face as with flat shading.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
  <div align="middle">
    <img src="images/part4/edge-flip-diagram.png" align="middle" width="100%">
  </div>
</p>
<p>
  We followed the
  <a href="http://15462.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2015content/misc/HalfedgeEdgeOpImplementationGuide.pdf">guide</a>
  linked in the primer on the <code>HalfEdgeMesh</code> class. To aid us in
  implementing and debugging, we first drew the above diagram showing the local
  neighborhood before and after the edge flip, with each element labeled. In
  <code>HalfedgeMesh::flipEdge()</code>, we first check if
  <code>e0->isBoundary()</code> and return immediately if so. We then collect
  all the elements from the "before" picture, naming the variables in our code
  with the same names as in the diagram. Next, we exhaustively update all the
  pointers for all the mesh elements affected by the flip, referring to the
  "after" diagram. We call <code>Halfedge::setNeighbors()</code> for every
  <code>HalfedgeIter</code> to save lines. For example,
  <code>h0->setNeighbors(h1, h3, v2, e0, f0);</code> sets <code>h0->next() =
  h1</code>, <code>h0->twin() = h3</code>, <code>h0->vertex() = v2</code>,
  <code>h0->edge() = e0</code>, and <code>h0->face() = f0</code> all with one
  function call. The <code>HalfedgeIter</code> pointer in every
  <code>VertexIter</code>, <code>EdgeIter</code>, and <code>FaceIter</code> is
  set. Finally, we return the same <code>EdgeIter</code> <code>e0</code> since it
  is the iterator to the flipped edge.

<b>
    Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.
</b>
<p>
  Our first attempt at implementing the edge flip ultimately failed, as we
  suspect that we had some incorrect and/or missing pointer reassignments. This
  first attempt was done before reading the guide, and the main difference in
  our approach was that we didn't rotate the halfedges with the faces; instead,
  we only moved the halfedges along the flipped edge and reassigned the
  pointers of the other halfedges to point to the correct faces. We also were
  simply not exhaustive in our pointer reassignments. This first attempt,
  however, was crucial in helping us understand the edge flip operation as a
  whole and how elements and pointers should change.
</p>
<p>
  After following the guide, we checked our implementation by viewing the
  pointers of the affected mesh elements in the <code>meshedit</code> GUI and
  verifying correct behavior over multiple flips of the same edge. For
  instance, we checked that the halfedges' next and twin pointers were correct
  by comparing them before and after a flip.

<p>
  Following a similar technique as we did in Part 4, we meticulously labeled
  and drew out each vertex, half edge, edge, and face for both the “pre” and
  “post” edge split. This time, we had to create a new vertex (at the midpoint
  of the original edge), half edges, and faces. To implement the split, we
  reassigned pointers for all vertices, half edges, edges, and faces based on
  the diagram shown below. Although meticulous, this was the most
  straightforward and bug-free approach.

<p>
  An initial segfault we experienced was addressed by calling
  <code>HalfedgeMesh::newHalfEdge()</code> instead of
  <code>halfEdgeIter()</code> since we are trying to add new elements to the
  mesh. Before this change, the new elements were not being allocated and added
  to the mesh, causing segfaults when pointers to them were dereferenced. A
  second bug we had was a split's new vertex had default position <code>(0.0,
  0.0, 0.0)</code> because we had forgotten to actually set its new position.
  This was addressed by making sure we set the position of the newly created
  vertex to the midpoint of the original edge.
</p>

<br>


<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
  Our implementation essentially follows the algorithm outlined in the spec
  for Part 6. Iterating over all the original vertices in the mesh, we mark
  these vertices as <code>isNew = false</code> and set their
  <code>newPosition</code> fields based on the provided formula. Then, we do
  the same for all the old edges in the mesh, setting these edges as
  <code>isNew = false</code> and calculating the <code>newPosition</code>
  fields based on the provided formula. At this point, no changes have been
  made to the mesh. Then we split every edge in the mesh, making sure to
  iterate using the proper while loop provided in the primer in order to
  ensure we're iterating properly since we're changing the mesh as we
  iterate. Then, edges that connect an old and new vertex were flipped.
  Finally, the <code>newPosition</code> field is copied into the
  <code>position</code> field.
</p>


<p>
  Implementation/Debugging tricks: 1) One bug that we found was related to how
  we were labeling newly created edges in <code>splitEdge()</code>. More
  specifically, upon examining the diagram below
<p>
  <div align="middle">
    <img src="images/part5/edge-split-diagram.png" align="middle" width="100%">
  </div>
</p>
  the <code>e7</code> edge created in the "after split" diagram is technically
  not "new" as it is the bottom half of the previous <code>e0</code> edge in
  the "before split" diagram. We made sure to flag the <code>isNew</code> field
  according to this. During our debugging, we also made sure to change our
  conditions before splitting edge, double checking that an edge
  <code>isNew</code> is <code>false</code> and that both an edge's vertices are
  old before it's split.

  Additionally, after splitting an edge, we forgot to reset the
  <code>newPosition</code> field of the vertex returned, so during our
  debugging process, we were sure to address this.
</p>

  In the case of <code>dae/cube.dae</code>, the cube gets subdivided
  asymmetrically (more on this in the next section). In general, we notice that

  The icosahedron has less sharp corners compared to the cube, but they remain
  noticeable after subdivision nonetheless.
</p>
<p>
  Our first attempt at pre-splitting edges of the icosahedron involved
  splitting each original edge, this seemed to make things worse by adding
  more vertices that become prominent after subdivision:

<p>
  We then tried with <code>dae/cube.dae</code>. Here, all original edges are
  pre-split, creating 12 new vertices. These new vertices add to the neighbors
  of the original 4 vertices of the cube, which influences the calculation of
  the new positions of the corners during subdivision. To calculate the new
  position of a vertex, we use the following formula: <code>(1 - n * u) *
    original_position + u * original_neighbor_position_sum</code>, where
  <code>n</code> is the vertex degree. Each corner vertex now has an additional
  3 neighboring vertices that contribute to the sum of neighboring vertex
  positions, decrease the weight $u = \frac{3}{8n}$, and overall cause the
  corner vertices to not move as much since there is a higher weight on their
  original positions in the average. However, this still adds 12 new vertices
  that become more noticeable than the corners. The approach in the next
  section produces a smoother result.

<p>
  Upon further experimentation and thought, it doesn't seem like it is possible
  to reliably reduce the effects of sharp corners and edges by pre-splitting
  edges on shapes that are already regular. If done unregularly, pre-splitting
  edges only adds to the number of vertices and edges and divides up faces in
  concentrated areas, amplifying the effect we are trying to alleviate. As a
  preview of the next section, in the case of the cube, pre-splitting to make
  the edges/faces symmetrical helps the asymmetry, but it doesn't alleviate the
  effect of the corners of the cube. Any more pre-splitting or pre-flipping
  alters the overall shape of the cube or adds more uneven edges/complexity and
  leads to an amplification of the effect of sharp corners and edges.

<b>
  Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.
</b>
<p>
  One simple way we discovered to alleviate the asymmetry after repeated
  subdivisions was to pre-split each diagonal edge of each face so that the
  edges would be symmetrical before subdivision.

  After this preprocessing, the cube subdivides symmetrically:

<p>
  As shown in the final image with 5 subdivisions, the cube is subdivided
  symmetrically, but is now more shaped like a very rounded die. Before this
  pre-splitting, each of the 6 faces of the cube had one diagonal edge
  splitting it into two mesh faces, which produced asymmetry and causes the
  corners of the cube to become sharp the cube gets subdivided. However, with
  the pre-splits, each of the 6 cube faces has an "X" created by two diagonal
  edges, and the "extraordinary" points are instead located at the intersection
  of the two edges, or in other words the center of each original cube face.
  This pre-processing makes the corners of the cube less sharp, but makes the edges
  more sharp, which is why the asymmetrical and sharp corners disappear and why
  the shape looks more like a die than a round sphere.
