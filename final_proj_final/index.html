  <h3 align="middle">Abstract</h3>
  <p>
    In this project, we create a physics animation simulating a Rube Goldberg
    machine involving planks that a ball will interact with as it falls down
    and “completes the course.” We simulate the  kinematics of a rolling ball
    colliding with and rolling down surfaces. From a physics standpoint, we
    determined the forces and directions acting on all objects in the scene in
    order to create a realistic simulation. From a computer graphics angle, we
    used OpenGL to display the physical interactions, and created keyboard and
    console line inputs to specify course presets and other parameters.
    Overall, we were able to create a realistic-looking 2D physics animation of
    a ball interacting with many other objects.

    We’ve created new classes for the Ball and Plank objects. The Mass struct,
    which we inherited from discussion, contains a position, last_position
    (from the last time step), mass (of the object), and whether or not the
    object is pinned. The Ball class contains a Mass struct to store position
    information, as well as fields to store the Ball’s mass and radius. The
    Plank class stores the two endpoints of each plank, as well as a friction
    coefficient for balls rolling down the plank.

  <p>
    Our ball moves under a <code>simulateEuler()</code> function, which applies
    the total external forces on the ball to calculate new velocity and move
    the ball to its next position. When free-falling, the ball is acted upon by
    a downwards gravitational force. To detect a collision between a ball and a
    plank, we model each plank as a ray, with two endpoints and a direction. We
    define the equation of the plank as a ray using its endpoints and
    direction, and the equation of the ball as a circle using the ball’s radius
    and center position. Setting the two equations equal to each other, we can
    solve a quadratic equation to figure out whether or not there is an
    intersection, and where the intersection point is, as explained in this
    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1073336/circle-line-segment-collision-detection-algorithm">
    post</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    To simulate the motion of a ball rolling down a plank, we first calculate
    the total force exerted by the plank on the ball: the normal force exerted
    on any stationary ball, and an extra reactionary force to the ball’s
    existing velocity upon collision with the plank. The normal force has
    magnitude |gravity| * cos(theta), and points in the same direction as the
    normal to the plank. This is calculated using the diagram below; the normal
    force must equal to component of gravity perpendicular to the plank, which
    is |gravity| * cos(theta). 
  </p>
  <p>
    However, when the ball falls on the plank with an initial velocity, that
    initial velocity is going to exert an additional force on the plank,
    resulting in an additional reactionary force from the plank to the ball.
    The reactionary force is calculated to cancel out the component of velocity
    perpendicular to the plank, and has the same direction and a magnitude of
    |velocity| * cos(alpha) * mass / delta_t, as seen in the diagram below.
    Given a new total force exerted on the ball, we calculate a new velocity
    vector for the ball, and update the ball’s position based on the new
    velocity.
  </p>
  <p>
    We also added a frictional force on the planks when the ball is rolling
    down. The frictional force is calculated as F=uN, where u is a
    predetermined frictional coefficient, and N is the normal force from the
    plank to the ball. The frictional force acts in the opposite direction of
    the ball’s velocity, and slows the ball down as it rolls along. 
  </p>
  <p>
    To simulate ball-to-ball collision, we used the elastic collision formulas,
    referring to the post linked here, therefore making the assumption that the
    balls are colliding elastically, with no loss of kinetic energy. Using
    conservation of momentum and kinetic energy equations, we were able to
    calculate the new velocities as: 
  </p>

  <p>
    V1’ = v1 - 2m2/(m1 + m2) * dot(v1 - v2, x1 - x2) / norm(x1 - x2), in the direction of x1 - x2
  </p>
  <p>
    V2’  = v2 - 2m1/(m1 + m2) * dot(v1 - v2, x1 - x2) / norm(x1 - x2), in the direction of x1 - x2
  </p>
  <p>
    Ball-to-ball collision was detected whether the centers of two balls are
    closer than the sum of their radii. We call ball-to-ball collision before
    detecting ball-to-plank collision, so that the new velocities can be
    adjusted based on whether or not the balls were colliding into some other
    object in the same time step. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Inspired by the game Cut the Rope, we modify the original Rope class to
    include a Ball at one of the ends that can swing and be released when the
    Rope is “cut.” Because the Ball class maintains a Mass struct as its core,
    we simply create a Ball object and add its Mass as part of the final Spring
    contained by the Rope. To “cut” the Rope, we reduce the spring constant of
    the final Spring of the Rope to 0, reset the forces on the Mass of the Ball
    to 0, and stop drawing the Rope.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    <b>Keyboard Input</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    The rope_simulation discussion code already implements the
    Application::keyboard_event() function. To add more keyboard input, we
    simply add more cases mapping characters to events. To [C]ut the Rope,
    press ‘C’ on the keyboard. This calls our cutRope() function, whose effects
    are described in the physics section. If the Rope is not cut by the user,
    it will be automatically cut after 184 render() loops occur, tracked by a
    counter. We bind [P]ause and [U]npause functionality to ‘U’ and ‘P’. The
    user can [R]eset the current course by pressing ‘R’ on the keyboard. This
    calls our reset() function that places all moving objects back to their
    original positions, resets the simulation counter, and unpauses the
    simulation to begin again. Courses 1-6 are bound to their respective
    numbers on the keyboard for quick and easy initialization of each course.
  </p>
  <br>

  <h3 align="middle">Problems Encountered</h3>
  <p>
    <b>Ball-Plank collision</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    Initially, we simulated the ball rolling down a plank as a set force in the
    direction of the plank, scaled up to a set magnitude. However, this does
    not take into account the initial velocity the ball has when landing on the
    plank, nor the friction or acceleration the ball gains upon rolling down
    the ramp. We fixed the collision physics to include the normal force from
    the plank to the ball, as well as an elastic force due to the initial
    velocity of the ball onto the ramp. Each of these forces have components
    perpendicular and parallel to the plank, which affect the ball’s
    acceleration down the plank. We also added a configurable friction force in
    the opposite direction of velocity. With these fixes, we saw significant
    improvements in the simulation, allowing for a more realistic animation.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    <b>Ball-to-Ball overlap</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    We encountered a bug where the two balls colliding would overlap before
    moving apart. The issue was simple -- instead of calculating the distance
    between the centers of two balls, we were calculating the distance squared
    (Vector2D.norm2() instead of Vector2D.norm() in the code) in our check for
    whether or not the balls touched, which meant that we weren’t detecting a
    ball-to-ball collision until the distances were very close.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    <b>Rope-Ball release physics</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    After implementing the physics for when our rope is “cut” and the ball is
    released, we noticed that the release velocity of the ball (which is
    expected given that it has angular momentum from the rope swinging) was not
    being simulated: instead, the ball was just dropping straight down from its
    last position. We realized that the issue of this bug was due to the
    imbalance of the strength of our springs and the mass of the ball. After
    simply increasing the mass of the ball in the simulation, we saw
    improvements in the simulation.
  </p>
  <br>

  <h3 align="middle">Lessons Learned</h3>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Start with given code: saved us time when integrating with OpenGL so we
        could spend time designing the physics of our simulation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Have separate classes for each object: we were debating whether or not
        to use the “Mass” class as a ball, but having a separate Ball class
        made it much easier to keep track of variables and properties. This
        illustrates the power of abstraction, as we easily created a ball at
        the end of a rope by composing the Rope and Ball class together because
        we modeled the ball as having a Mass at its center and a radius. The
        Rope could then just have its final Mass object be that of a Ball.
        Moreover, implementing the reset() function was trivial because Rope
        and Ball are composed of Mass structs. We could just implement
        Mass::reset(), which resets the position to its start_position and
        zeroes out velocity and forces, once and then reuse it for the other
        objects’ reset() functions. Then Ball::reset() just requires calling
        reset() on its Mass, and Rope::reset() simply involves calling reset()
        on each Mass in its vector of Masses.
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep track of directions: Oftentimes, our bugs came from inputting the
        opposite direction, whether that be the direction of the frictional
        force on a plank or the normal direction from the plank. This results
        in our ball velocities increasing instantaneously, often flying out of
        the frame in one or two timesteps. Keeping track of vector directions
        would help streamline our physics development a lot. 
      </li>
    </ul>
