    <h3 align="middle">Summary</h3>

    <p>
        We want to create a physics animation, simulating a Rube Goldberg
        machine involving planks that a ball will interact with as it falls
        down and “completes the course.” As a stretch goal, we want to open
        functionality to allow the user to indicate the initial starting
        position of the ball to be dropped into the machine.
    </p>

    <h3 align="middle">Problem Description</h3>
    <p>
        The main problem is trying to simulate the kinematics of a rolling ball
        colliding with and rolling down surfaces. From a physics standpoint, we
        must determine the proper mass of the ball and friction
        coefficient/angles of the planks in order to create a realistic
        simulation. From a computer graphics angle, we will need to implement
        not just the physics above (likely using the <a
        href="https://byjus.com/physics/kinematics-equations/">four kinematic
        equations</a>) in addition to implementing collisions with between the
        ball and course obstacles such as in Project 4. Because each of the
        planks in a simulation are disparate objects (separated by position),
        we anticipate a challenge in utilizing data structures that can help us
        efficiently determine when a ball is colliding/rolling on a surface and
        when it’s free falling. Additionally, the physical rotational movement
        of individual point masses on the ball is something we implement as
        well.
    </p>

    <h3 align="middle">Goals and Deliverables</h3>
    <p>
        <b>
            What we plan to deliver + how we will measure the quality of the system:
        </b>
    </p>

    <p>
        We plan to deliver an animation video of a ball falling down an
        obstacle course. It will be a 2D animation, similar to the mobile game
        “Cut the Rope”, with the ball initially being hung up by a rope and
        falling down onto the planks and rolling into a final bucket. We will
        measure the quality of the system by observing how “realistic” the
        physical simulation is, including: whether or not there are any
        unintentional merges when two objects collide, whether or not
        acceleration and velocity are modeled correctly, and whether or not the
        ball ends up in the location it’s supposed to.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            What we hope to deliver:
        </b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Ideally, we hope to deliver an interactive kinematics simulator where
        the user can customize obstacles and initial states. The user can swipe
        to cut the initial rope, adjust the angles and locations of each plank,
        wall, and obstacle, as well as different properties of the ball and
        other objects (such as elasticity, weight…etc).

    <h3 align="middle">Schedule</h3>
    <p>
        Schedule by week:

        <ol>
            <li>Simulate a circular ball rolling down a singular incline
                horizontal plank.
            </li>
            <li>Build an "obstacle" course of horizontal, angled planks and
                drop a ball through the course.
            </li>
            <li>Add ropes at the end of planks to simulate circular motion +
                add “portal” so the simulation can repeat.
            </li>
            <li>Add “game aspects” where user can specify mass, friction of
                planks, time before cutting of rope after ball is attached in
                order to get the ball in final goal.
            </li>
        </ol>

        The fourth week is our stretch goal. If we run into unexpected
        problems, that final week will be our buffer week to achieve the first
        three goals.
