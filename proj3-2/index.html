        <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Project 3-2 is a short extension of Project 3-1 and offered us the
            option of choosing to implement two or more rendering effects out
            of four. We chose Part 1: Mirror and Glass Materials and Part 4:
            Depth of Field largely because we thought these two parts were the
            most visually interesting. Implementing Part 1 involved updating
            the BSDF functions for Mirror (reflecting light) and Glass
            (reflecting and refracting light) objects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Implementing refraction in particular involved Applying Snell’s law
            $\sin \theta = \eta \cdot \sin \theta$. Implementing the full
            glass material effect involved estimating the results of the
            Fresnel equations, which models the ratio between reflection and
            refraction at a certain point on a glass object.
        </p>
        <p>
            Depth of Field in Part 4 was implemented by simulating a thin lens
            between the scene and camera sensor and sampling this lens at
            random points rather than the traditional pin-hole camera model
            that we’ve used to render up to this point. Rendering pictures from
            this part in particular took some experimentation. We found that
            entering “BVH” mode in the GUI in particular helped us change the
            camera angle so that we could get the right effect on the dragon.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although this was a shorter project, the results were just as
            rewarding as in Project 3-1. As partners, we were far more familiar
            with the codebase when starting, so we were able to jump to our
            implementations quicker. What took time on this project wasn’t the
            coding, but the rendering. Ultimately, it was an exploration of the
            concepts we covered in class.

            Point out the new multibounce effects that appear in each image. Explain how these bounce numbers relate to the particular effects that appear. Make sure to include all screenshots.
        </b></p>
        <p>
            When <code>max_ray_depth = 0</code>, we only get zero bounce
            illumination, meaning only the area light source is visible. When
            <code>max_ray_depth = 1</code>, we get zero bounce illumination and
            one bounce illumination (direct illumination). When
            <code>max_ray_depth > 1</code>, we get direct illumination and
            indirect illumination, so we see the reflected light from the
            walls, for instance, fill and color the ceiling, floor, and
            shadows. We also get enough bounces for reflection and refraction
            of light through the <code>MirrorBSDF</code> and
            <code>GlassBSDF</code>. When <code>max_ray_depth = 2</code>, we get
            a maximum of 2 bounces. The left sphere has a
            <code>MirrorBSDF</code> so it is reflecting light. For instance,
            the camera ray hits the left sphere, then bounces in the reflected
            direction to the red wall, and then bounces to the area light
            source. This path is the reverse direction that the light from the
            area light source travels to get to the camera. The sphere on the
            right has a <code>GlassBSDF</code> so it is both reflecting and
            refracting light based on the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_equations">Fresnel
            equations</a> which we calculate using <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlick's_approximation">Schlick's
            approximation</a>. With two bounces, we get reflection just as with the
            left mirror sphere, so we observe the small specular highlight on the top
            of the right glass sphere from direct illumination. However, we don't yet
            have refraction because there is not enough bounces. For instance, if the
            camera ray hits the right glass sphere, it will refract in the calculated
            refraction direction, bounce internally and refract through the other
            side of the glass sphere, and hit a wall and not the area light source.
            Once we get to <code>max_ray_depth = 3</code>, we have enough bounces for
            the light to bounce from the wall to the glass sphere, refract through
            twice, and hit the camera. We also get a concentrated pool of light on
            the ground underneath the glass ball. When <code>max_ray_depth =
            4</code>, we see a patch of light on the blue wall that refracted through
            the glass sphere. We also see a concentration of light on the underside of
            the glass sphere above the pool of light on the ground beneath it. When
            <code>max_ray_depth = 5 and 100</code>, at this sample rate, there are no
            new distinct visual effects that appear with each
            <code>max_ray_depth</code> increase as there are already enough bounces for
            reflection and refraction to occur, and the light in higher and higher
            bounces decays.

        <h3 align="middle">Part 4. Depth of Field</h3>
        <b>
            For these subparts, we recommend using a microfacet BSDF scene to show off the cool out of focus effects you can get with depth of field!
        </b>
        <p><b>
            In a few sentences, explain the differences between a pinhole camera model and a thin-lens camera model. 
        </b></p>
        <p>
            In a pinhole camera model, there is a single point through which
            light rays from the scene pass to create an image on the camera
            sensor. The light rays all converge at this point before hitting
            the camera sensor, and all elements of the scene are in focus. In a
            thin lens camera model, there is a single lens in between the scene
            and the camera sensor through which light rays pass. The light is
            refracted through the lens and meets at a single point which is in
            focus. If the light rays coming from an object in the scene
            converge at a focus point that is on the sensor, the object will be
            in focus in the image. If the focus point is before after the
            sensor, the object will be out of focus in the image as the light
            rays are blurred in a disk.

            In terms of our pathtracer, in a pinhole camera model, there is no
            lens for light to travel through. Instead, a camera ray is shot
            into the scene and the radiance of the scene is reflected back into
            the sensor, with no refraction occurring, the light traveling in a
            straight line. With a thin-lens, the image sensor is not only able
            to receive light from the origin, but from any point across the
            surface of the thin lens. In our implementation, we are uniformly
            sampling across different points on the lens
